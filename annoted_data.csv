LaO2ZSqc6rN3AZmDXcgU2Q,FpyjR9TiaO3JyynpF-y-7g,"Service and food are meh. I came here once in the fall last year to watch football with my gf and we were two of maybe 5 people at the bar. There was one bartender and I couldn't tell if she was in a bad mood, acted normally like that, or would just rather spend her shift talking to her friends on the other side of the bar. We got our food after a bit and had to ask for new avocado since the ones in our plate were literally black. Food was ok the first trip. 
Tried it again this week and wanted to give it another shot since they have a wide beer selection. Sat at the bar with my buddy and the bartender was nicer, but same wait time...not many people at the bar and takes a while to get service or your check, even after making eye contact. Food was worse this time and my buddy said his Alfredo looked like a 4th grader made it from a box. I wanted to like it, but there are better places to go for sports and beer without having to feel like an inconvenience or get iffy food. 
Water and silverware don't come standard apparently, at least at the bar.",2022-01-08 14:52:13,neg,cf

9sMReBdqs47Mf3mrA2CzZA,1VPpbFms0augW1raf8cycw,"The staff was friendly and helpful, the boat ride itself was fun. But the food was hot trash and the drinks were a total disappointment.

So the food portions were ok, but the chicken was way over-salted-to the point that we couldn't eat it. The meat in the gumbo clearly came from a can and the deserts came in portions smaller than you would give to a child.

We paid extra for extra drink tickets and we didn't find out until the boat got underway that we could only get beer, Bloody Marys and shitty Woodbridge wine. We had to pay for all the good booze separately.

There are better ways to see the river on a boat. This place was a huge waste of money and an even bigger disappointment. Whatever bean counter decided to skimp on the food and booze is running this company into the ground.

If the Chef would actually taste test the food before it gets to the customers and if the drink tickets weren't a ripoff then this experience would easily deserve 5 stars.",2022-01-16 23:51:15,neg,cf

I asked if they had a hot tub and swimming pool and they said yes but there was no hot tub. I thought okay miscommunication. We got to the room and no bath towels. I called three times and finally the front desk said come down and get some towels, so I did! Then I ordered a wake up call and the cord kept coming out of the back of the phone because it was broken. They sent up maintenance who told me not to move the phone so the wire doesn't fall out, duh! Then the next day I called to ask if there was a breakfast they said yes but they didn't know what they had. Then I was getting breakfast when a man came up to me and gave me the third degree about where's my voucher? What voucher I asked? He said I needed to buy a voucher but he never said where, for breakfast which was never communicated by anyone until I was getting breakfast and he had to make a scene in public and I left the food.

the flavoring in the nigiri always seems really thoughtful and the rice is superb, but the rolled sushi doesn't always match that. I'd go for simpler rolls here or skip them entirely and focus on the parts of their menu that really shine.

They do require proof of vaccination to dine in. They're very, VERY public about it, so there's really no need to angrily flounce out of the restaurant like the dude that was in front of me the last time we dined in...and yet.

There were tons of things to see and lots to learn! There were lots of good FL native creatures, lots of red fish/snook/tarpon, which are always fun to see. The Alligators were cool & we learned a lot about jelly fish, Otters, and sting rays!
I loved taking pictures and we were mesmerized by all of the cool animals! We even got to meet/touch Patrick Star!!!
The only downfall is the price. Unless you are getting the year membership and are going to go several times throughout the year, it's expensive.

I have spoken with each employee over my years here, on the phone and in person- super thorough, and super informative.  I trust them with anything and everything for my vehicles and certified documents.  They send reminders, and explain everything 10 times if you need them too.

fnvKnScjT-FQQlm6-bUzgg,XQck31fDZh8akpmeBojFng,"This place is really good. 

My wife loved the sausage sandwich. They slice the sausage down with the peppers and onions. It makes the sandwich look a little slender as opposed to serving it intact, but I assure you it had enough. She needed a fork to finish the insides. I tasted and I concur. That's a worthy sandwich. 

I tried the cheeseburger. Just went for a basic single with cheese to see how they did it. It had a decent enough amount of beef. I didn't feel like it skimped. It's on par with the Zac's and Nifty Fifty's level, smash style. I'd keep it in my burger rotation. 

I also tried a Texas Tommy. Great flavor. The bacon crisped nice around the dog. Just the way I like it. 

We all loved the fries. Excellent shoestring style. Dare I say on par with McDonalds. 

Now my son... he's a little picky. And he's recently learned about the Portnoy pizza scale. So he scores everything now. He gave the cheeseburger a 6.6. Said it was good but not the best he's had. But the hot dog was an 8.9 which was excellent. And a 10 on the fries (rookie score). 

He's tough. He's a picky 8 year old. Get on his case not mine.

In fact, last night it was just bad.  The chicken dish and the striped bass dish that my girlfriend and I had were incredibly salty, waaaay too salty.  The broccolini I had was awful, like trying to cut through and chew bamboo. And the meal did not have a starch component?  Why?  Just salty chicken and bamboo-like broccolini.

They did comp the chicken, which was nice, but the food itself is not a 4 or 5 star experience.  They try hard, are very friendly and have good service, but the food is overrated.",2022-01-09 18:31:19,neg,cf

While our waitress was very personable and polite, the food was simply basic and the portions were gigantic.  We ordered a simple pasta dish and a side of vegetables.  The pasta dish was enough to feed a family of four and the side veggies were way over cooked. The dessert we ordered, a berry apple tart, looked and tasted like it had been sitting for too long and was gooey and slimy in the center.  Perhaps we were there on an off night.

Dr. Jermey is a weak man that abuses his power to fire stellar employees that are medically exempt from the forced vaccine for COVID-19. He was so weak that he couldn't outright ask his employees their status- upon basically harassing and finding out he immediately terminated an elderly naturopathic doctor and the massage therapist that had him implement any sort of protocol to the office in the first place as he was never complaint from the beginning. All of the sudden he went full in talked down and degraded these women due to his very one sided stuck thinking. Do your research, sorry but you're wrong...

Stay away from this place. The owner is unsure of himself and doesn't know how to run a business. The employee turnover rate is rapid and they will spam you with poorly created emails and Groupon deals begging for your business. .

Live music, beignets, wine, what more could you look for?  I was surprised by just how many food options there were--there should be something for all the people in your group! The ticket system makes it really efficient to buy your food/drinks.  You'll buy your food/drink tickets in batches at specific stands which you use for the vendors.   

It is definitely a CROWDED event. Plan on parking a few blocks away. If you go later in the day, all the tables will already be claimed since many people literally will spend the whole day here.  Maybe bring a lawn chair for back-up seating! 

Bonus Tip: While you are in Meridian Kessler, be sure to take a walk around to checkout the unique architecture in the neighborhood. From itty-bitty bungalows, Tudors, Colonial, and more there is so much to take a peak at.

I had an oil change done on my Tacoma. The oil change lasted roughly 32minutes. In addition, the young man who did the oil change seemed to have left the skid plate loose to the point where I heard it rattling while driving on the highway. When I got home, I found the skid plate uneven. It appears that instead of threading on the screws by hand and then tightening them onto the skid plate instead he just jammed the screws in, damaging the thread. This seems like a minor issue, but now I'm thinking about what else could have been done wrong.

I'd rather take 30minutes and have the job done right and at a lower price than 30minutes and have to deal with this inconvenience.

Avoid if you drive a Tacoma.

XW6BU6Y5ULACzf_DU9C2sw,ta0D02-YVpTJ5gzMAUMBTQ,"Uhm not so sure about this place. I've been only one times before. Long before Covid. I know that has changed A LOT of things in the restaurant/business world. Hubby brought me here on a Monday as the sign said open. As noted it's a bit of a strange location, but the interior really is beautiful.  I think we got there about 3:30 and walked in to the place all to ourselves.  Nobody was behind the bar, we kind of saw half of someone lingering in the back. About 6-7 minutes of just sitting there (also got uninterrupted pictures of the place so that was cool) a lady walked out and asked if she could help us.  It was the most unwelcome greeting I've had in a long time. I asked if they had butterscotch schnapps as that is what I was craving, they do not so I just ordered a white Russian as a martini.  My husband ordered a Shirley temple as he is not a big drinker. She like half laughed/scoffed at him in the rudest way when he ordered that. I was pretty angry when she did that and felt like leaving right then and there. Not to mention sounded like she had been coughing in the back room before coming out. 

However she then ended up asking me if I would like vanilla vodka in my drink and I said yes. I thought that was nice she asked.  She made our drinks and we ordered a pepperoni flat bread.  Seems she may have been the only worker as she went in the back and stayed there, all the while coughing more which really stressed me out. Wondering if she was tainting our food honestly, hate to think like that but the vibe we got was not good. 

While drinking my drink it was okay I kind of didn't like it but it was drinkable, I noted to my husband that it tasted a little too much like a coffee espresso drink and that I had never had a White Russian that tasted like that - maybe the vanilla vodka had thrown it off.  Of note, I do not drink coffee I don't like it.  The pizza then came out looking delicious, And it was. It was very very good with lots of pepperoni that had a great kick to it.  Once we finished that we were ready to go. Nobody else had come in yet and it was just very awkward.  She warmed up s bit knowing we were leaving and asked how my drink was, I said it was good - she pulled out a bottle and said ""I used this instead of kahlua"" - it was espresso liquor.  It was strange to me that she asked if vanilla vodka was ok but didn't ask if his espresso liquor was ok. I would have said no to that. Cry face. 

Anyhow I think she was happy to see us go and we were happy to go.  The reason for 3 stars is the flatbread and the atmosphere/decor. Seems like it could be an amazing place, we may try it on a weekend night instead of when nobody else is there but I also was pretty turned off by the whole experience, however again i do know things are weird. I'm not sure if that was the owner we encountered. I came upon a review about a year ago that touched on same thing as me, a very unwelcoming feeling. Very strange as that initial interaction set the tone, would have been nice if she had come out introduced Herself and acted like she cared. :(",1/19/22 4:29,neg,reviews-MR

Rh7gLnlrLtud9-cJ2U2BAQ,cxO6sGcERAAT2NKAZBfx3w,"Rating one star because there is no option for zero. 

READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS before you consider living in this apartment complex. The staff is condescending, unprofessional, and inexperienced. I've had problems with this complex from the day I moved in, which due to a leasing office mistake I moved in a day later than scheduled.

The first maintenance request my roommate and I reported was about our a/c not working on the hottest days of the year.After 3 days maintenance was sent down, looked at our thermostat and told us nothing was wrong. Our thermostat was set to 75 degrees, but was constantly running for 18 hrs a day and the temperature was staying at 89 degrees all day long.Three days later the A/C was still constantly running and had not been repaired.4 more calls, and around a week later during a call to the front office, I requested to speak to the property manager and maintenance supervisor ASAP, at this point the lady working in the office yells at me!! She said ""Who the hell do you think you are? You can't tell me what to do!""... I hung up and 10 minutes later maintenance was at my door, took an hour to repair my A/C, and again said nothing was wrong. Due to the lack of repairs our electrical bill TRIPLED in price!!

During the summer storms this year my unit received plenty of water damage to the ceiling, and the walls. My roommate and I again, reported it the same day it occurred. A day later maintenance shows up  with buckets to catch the dripping water and cuts the bubbled ceiling off to let the drywall dry. A week goes by with no sign of the maintenance coming back and we notice staining and green/brown/orange/black/grey mildew and mold growing around the cut out area. I am allergic to mold and reported it to the office staff immediately, the answer I got was unacceptable and extremely unprofessional....... I was told that Arizona doesn't have a mold problem and they would paint over it when they got the chance.... Completely disregarding my allergy. TWO MONTHS go by and not a single repair was made for the water damage, I personally went to the office to speak the the property manager and I was told my unit was the worst in the whole complex and they wouldn't work on it because the roof was under warranty and they wont touch it until they get that settled. I gave it another two weeks and not a single email, phone call, nothing. I once again go to the office and they feed me the same line, but this time the property manager offers to move us to a sister complex with higher rent and less amenities. I said no. Then she offered an apartment in this same complex two buildings over that also did not have the same amenities and we would have to wait three months just before we moved in. I said no. We signed a lease for this exact apartment and they are supposed to keep it habitable and make reasonable repairs in a timely manner. Not a single update came back to us. We made a final maintenance request and demanded it be taken care of. The same day the maintenance supervisor came and cut the moldy drywall off the ceiling, exposed the rotting insulation, scraped off the mold and then placed the exact same piece of drywall back onto the roof and covered it up. We immediately told him that was not acceptable and we were not satisfied with the repair made. Another note, the maintenance WILL NOT clean up their mess. They left drywall shaving/paint/scuff marks all over the carpet, ""wood"" floors, and the walls, shown in pictures below. Now they claim to have fixed the issue and have not made anymore repairs. There is still a hole in the master bedroom bathroom that you can see in the pictures below. It has been 6 WHOLE MONTHS since I first reported this problem and I am still living with holes in my walls.

I could type pages explaining all the problems we have encountered at this unprofessional apartment complex but I decided to compact it to the most unsettling events.

If you haven't been to Garwood's or Riva Grill, you definitely need to check out Sparks water bar. They all have beautiful views and similar decor, menu, and great service. The location is what makes this place extra special and worth the higher price tag, it's a beautiful experience to go along with good food and drinks. 

We started out with the classic Woody's, their signature cocktail that is fruity and blended with lots of rum. These go down easy!

We skipped appetizers and went straight to our meal, again, the price tag is a bit hefty so we were being mindful of the overall bill.

See photos for exactly what we ordered, everyone was pleased with their meal. I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and beautifully presented. The risotto was very creamy, almost a bit too much for my taste. I like a good al dente risotto. Hubby said that his prime rib was not as good as he expected. It is a very thick cut and was not very tender, although well seasoned and well sauced. The salmon was cooked medium, which is great for a salmon lover but my sister was thrown off that it wasn't fully cooked, but was also not asked how she'd like it done. She said it was delicious anyway. The pasta dish was a cross between carbonara and mac & cheese - very rich and creamy!

There were many people milling outside the entrance.  I walked in and gave them my name.  They wished me a happy anniversary (our 50th) which was a nice touch and asked us to wait outside.  Even with all of the people waiting to get in, we were called only seven minutes after our reservation.  Very impressive.  We were seated and Daniela, our server, arrived almost immediately.  She also wished us a happy anniversary and took our drink orders.  The restaurant was so cold they could have hung raw meat in the dining room to have it stay fresh but we each brought a light jacket with us for moments just like this.  So far, so good. Now on to the food.  We hit the salad bar first.  If only it tasted as good as it looked.  Most of the good tasting items were average and some were pretty awful.  My wife said the hearts of palm were inedible and the potatoes au gratin were exceptionally tasteless.  We were not going to let that get us down on our 50th plus we did not go there for salad.  Unfortunately, the meats were not much better.  Some were quite good (the flank steak and the top sirloin) and others were too well done, too salty or just plain tasteless they were inedible.  Had the Gauchos not told us, you couldn't figure out what cut of meat it was.  Being it was our anniversary, we were getting a piece of anniversary cheesecake provide by the restaurant.  My email stated it was their special ""Texas de Brazil Cheesecake"".

Even with all of the people waiting to get in, we were called only seven minutes after our reservation.  Very impressive.  We were seated and Daniela, our server, arrived almost immediately.  She also wished us a happy anniversary and took our drink orders.  The restaurant was so cold they could have hung raw meat in the dining room to have it stay fresh but we each brought a light jacket with us for moments just like this.  So far, so good. Now on to the food.  We hit the salad bar first.  If only it tasted as good as it looked.  Most of the good tasting items were average and some were pretty awful.  My wife said the hearts of palm were inedible and the potatoes au gratin were exceptionally tasteless.  We were not going to let that get us down on our 50th plus we did not go there for salad.  Unfortunately, the meats were not much better.  Some were quite good (the flank steak and the top sirloin) and others were too well done, too salty or just plain tasteless they were inedible.  Had the Gauchos not told us, you couldn't figure out what cut of meat it was.  Being it was our anniversary, we were getting a piece of anniversary cheesecake provide by the restaurant.

But I am changing my rating after I took my truck in for it's first oil change and found out I was being charged full price even though I have the GEM membership. (5 free oil changes for first 5 years) To keep this short, it is due to a incorrect date listing on there finance records. With one date saying I bought the truck in November 2020 and another saying the correct date of February 2021. This nullified my entire membership on there books even though I have the appropriate paperwork saying otherwise. The rating at this point is because it has been a month and a half of me reaching out to the dealership and all I receive back is ""ya it should be taken care of in a couple days"". Not once have they reached out to update me about anything. It's more of a major inconvenience and shows there lack of customer service capabilities that I did not expect from a well respected company and brand. I will have a tough time recommending Toyota at any point in the future even though I do truly love my truck. As well, the remote connect with your phone is only a trail to give you a heads up as mine ended after eight months even though I have heard of other people getting the service for 2 years?

scallion pancakes, fatty beef sour radish soup, salt and

Squid was an easy favorite, but I'm always a sucker for
that chewy goodness. I have to give a special shout out
to the radish soup. I would order this dish again just for
the noodles. They had this almost firm-Jello-like
consistency that gave the most perfect bite! And the
broth itself was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it.
Wouldn't order the lamb chops again - meat was dry

The sales lady tried to trade me out of the car offering me a worst condition vehicle with a higher odometer and cosmetically damaged,  the manager told that if wanted the turbos to be fixed I would have to pay half of the total price of the fixing which it was 4,500 and not 7,000 like they originally submitted to the power train warranty  they sold me  I ask the sales if I could have my money back and she said no that my options were vehicle trade or fixing my vehicle so I agreed on paying half of the fixing by a hand shake deal with the manager. after that  I called for weekly updates on the vehicle and everything was up in the air they didn't know  they didn't know they didn't know always giving me a different excuse that goes from ""we don't know were the parts are and ""the guy that was fixing ur vehicle died to ""we finally found the table that we going to put the parts to fix your car it's been three months of pure lies and  Yesturday ima went to check in the car and I found my car with a popped tire and a dented rim, I had to ask for answers and still no one knew anything they said the vehicle was done but they were now waiting on a new tire and they guy that was going to fix the rim. They  promise the vehicle will be ready today then today they called me to say that one of the AC lines was damaged through the process and they had to ordered it to the manufacturer and it was going to take longer funny thing  because the parts manager a month ago make an example of how the timeline could be affected by many reasons and he used that as an example of it and suddenly today that's the new excuse, the truth is that my car has been sitting down under a tree for the past three months and no one has done anything to it.

Overall just a nice guy who didn't make me feel like a loser for returning eight different slips I bought on Amazon and ended up not wanting. I'll definitely be coming here for all my future returns. Godspeed.",1/19/22 18:57,pos,borja
