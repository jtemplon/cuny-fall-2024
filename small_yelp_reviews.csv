-2yNYo2eVEqdeV5dELFPLQ,hA8c2kWI_8DXZE1jyVxlBQ,"GREAT staff and GREAT food!! My boyfriend had a fontina pizza, we split AMAZING sweet potato fries, and I had the famous grilled cheese with tomato soup. The grilled cheese was better as a vehicle for the soup than good on its own. The soup is so good but the grilled cheese dipped in the soup is the only way to do it!!! Def would recommend. 4 stars because I had acid reflux from the tomato soup (my own issue)",2022-01-02 00:48:22
LIRhXeeHR2RSFB2SRJjIPg,mRKxPMk9jHgCj07MwAMUzw,"Got a chicken bowl. The flavor wasn't bad but there just were several things that really just missed the mark here. The fajita veggies were basically raw and I asked for the mild salsa and I'm pretty sure I was given something a lot spicer (wasn't even diced tomatoes, it was just a red sauce). The chips had absolutely no seasoning (barely any salt or anything) and the guacamole we paid for was legit just a large cut piece of avocado with like a piece of onion and a little smidge of lime juice. Pretty sad, although somehow the chicken bowl was still tastier than Chipotle. . .",2022-01-16 19:48:40
MAbABE4lnYuKdPWvDUCUOA,fgtnOag-DaTsZTHPsgnWSQ,"Pick out this place by Yelp. Food was just so-so. I ordered a family Mongolian dinner with Cashew Chicken and Curry Chicken came. The curry chicken was horrible. Hot and sour soup was not either hot or sour, but tasted good. Won't get take out from here again.",2022-01-17 18:04:06
FOr1Q4dZByod684CHRRphA,vHr8qhM4CXYB3Ol_9yS6QQ,"Sushi pier has been on our list for a while, so we were so excited to order takeout! Service was super quick and while I only got a quick glimpse inside when I picked up our order, the space is so inviting and the decorations are delightful! 

We did the takeout combo of 3 rolls, 2 nigiri, and the moondog stars. It's such a great deal for the amount of food you get!! We also wanted to try the tempura stuffed calamari so we ordered those as well!

Everything was fresh and delicious, I especially loved the Mr Pink roll!! I'd probably skip the King Kong roll and the tempura stuffed calamari next time if we're ordering takeout just because I think they didn't travel super well, but we definitely can't wait to come try more in person here.",2022-01-06 20:00:34

TDHs_vTnRwwYm_NZR2CZRA,L-43PIGGgYV6BoK-GaW4Vw,"I've been here three times now and I'm really grateful to have this place within walking distance. 

The staff has been super friendly. I also appreciated how they professionally enforced COVID rules. They also handled a drunk guest very professionally and prevented anything from escalating. 

Food wise- I've had macaroni and cheese. Loved it. It's not overly heavy. The bang bang broccoli scared me when it came out because it just looked like a bunch of raw broccoli but they must have air fried it really good. It was awesome. The hot dog was good, the mustard on it was amazing. 

My only complaint is that I kept getting wine and when I got to the bottom there was a bunch of gunk floating in it.",2022-01-12 16:07:10
WTQURRJNU4PXAWF7VADj8w,iQp3QlP4iynGTXgFqpZ7Gg,"Megan was our waitress and she made the experience very awkward. She was so nice to the table behind us but was weird to us.

6m30HOcJRxCmoIffIH8ibA,1vPSY4EA-fTRIZYz1Ruzow,"Hate to say it but I don't understand what all of the hype is about! Was expecting long lines and crowds but ended up getting a table in the back room in the apartment complex lobby. Tried to order online with the QR code but it kept giving me an error that items in my cart were no longer available, but not specifying which items, so I ended up waiting in line to order anyway. 

No one in my group liked the grilled cheese Jerusalem bagel. One compared it to frozen Ellio's pizza- and they weren't wrong- yikes. The avocado kubaneh toast was good, but nothing special beyond your average avocado toast. The pistachio sticky bun was by far the stand out item, but definitely doesn't compare to the pastries at Suraya. I don't drink coffee but others in the group strongly disliked theirs. My Bloody Mary was horrible, one of the worst I've had. 

The items were delivered to the table sporadically with huge gaps of time in between. For example, we ordered 2 sticky buns and one came out right away and the other came out after we finished everything and were packing up to leave. 

Overall, a big ol' disappointment.",2022-01-09 22:32:11

0NfNSLz3WtkmCkxPO7x64g,xVZh156d7aBvdSCeWaoPQg,"I'm NEVER disappointed at this classy yet approachable spot. 

The vibe? Intimate, jazzy, unexpected. It's the perfect location for a date night or girl's night out. Plus there's an outdoor patio shielded from the street with lush foliage. 

The food? Modern Mediterranean. There's always a little delightful twist. 

We don't order calamari anywhere else because this is our favorite. Lightly breaded, tender, drizzled with sweet Thai chili sauce. But the best part is arguably the spicy pickled peppers they toss into the mix. 

We've never had a bad dish here. The wine deals are great, too! I've been dying to go for brunch!!!",2022-01-06 02:59:27

My son loves the garbage food they serve, but this location is filthy, has horrible customer service, never makes the pizza the same way twice, let's dogs behind the counter, does bad delivery, has an impossible parking lot .  . . need I say more?

Eat the drunken shrimp, but please don't blame me once your addiction starts; I stopped attending SA meetings years ago. All of their daily catch Fish specials are stellar, with grouper & snapper at the top. Love the ""old school"" vibe here. No pretentiousness, just some of the best seafood in Tampa Bay.

cLDkmumOvcWLixgYxkoAbw,F89mu4Dwig3vnmQ6qn0wtg,"In fairness to Extra space, they have 2 buildings on the 54th Ave. Kenneth City facility, the good reviews must be conform customers using the front building. The building in the back is a 2 star at best.
The last straw was a significant increase in the cost. My unit was in such a dimly lit area of the building I almost needed a flashlight. Several months after requesting light repair they had an electrician change the fluorescent tubes. Bathrooms out of order frequently and nasty which is not a big deal, only to the guy living in a unit. Good luck getting the Odor out of your furniture or whatever you are storing there. Other than these issues all else is fine! Oh, I suggest febreze for the smell.",2022-01-16 16:20:32
CkVSeq1LE05E6ZoC1t5RAg,Wf9Ir1pvAmQL5GXgBEvCcA,Food is good service at the bar. Is the worst in any place I have been. Rude always crazy rude. What do you want two seconds to take order. Never come back to ask and now left shift and no one take take our payment dishes have been sitting in front  us for 15 minutes. And still no one to pay.,2022-01-03 00:26:44

There were 2 cars in front of me and it moved quickly. The person taking the order was pleasant and patient. My food came out right and hot. It was everything you could hope for going through a Taco Bell Drive-Thru at midnight on a week day.
Would be open to returning.",2022-01-10 20:29:58
EFWj1dLCVOVBAzZb8wlxxg,ijZP_SZg8DJKYwAMjz-xSg,"I have two dogs, Isabelle and Willy. On January 4th I made a grooming appointment for Willy for January 6th and Isabelle on the 10th. On January 5th I confirmed it. Shortly thereafter, I received a phone call from Jamie the assistant store manager cancelling my appointment. I asked about rescheduling him for this Friday (7th), she told me she could not do that because she wasn't in grooming and she did not know if they had availability. I asked her several questions - even asked if they could fit Willy into the schedule with Isabelle. She kept arguing with me. I asked to speak to the grooming manager - she wasn't there. Eventually Jamie hung up on me after we had a back and forth about the pandemic, and being shortstaffed. I am very tired of hearing this and I expressed this. To which point, she said ""well sure the pandemic is all my fault!"" and hung up on me. I called back and asked for the District Manager information. The guy that answered transferred me BACK to Jamie where we had another conversation, I told her if she hung up on me again, I would come to the store and talk to her in person (meaning I would go to the store and TALK to her in person). During this call, she suggested I apply for a grooming position. I suggested she transfer to grooming. We also moved Willy's appointment for the 6th to Isabelle's appointment for the 10th. Today I called and spoke to Carol the grooming manager, who informed me that since it is now a conflict between me and Jamie (her claiming I threatened her), I can't bring my dogs in until its resolved. That's awesome customer service right there. I am still waiting for this district manager to call me. I am very upset, I have been bringing my dogs to PETCO FOR YEARS, I spend a lot of money at this store. I just needed my dogs to be groomed. Note that this is not the first time that they have just been unilaterally cancelled due to this store's lack of staff.",2022-01-07 14:09:16

Rjs16dBbIOAPXnMhIZSLhg,ngheCBHQblFSxrtsjLRnyA,I moved to Land O Lakes about a year ago and always wanted to try In The Loop Brewing. Safe to say it's the best bar I've been to in the area to date. I love that there is outside seating and plenty of places to hang out with people. The beer section was small but had beers I liked. The Tropical Hazy IPA was delicious and I loved it. Would have liked more IPAs to choose from but was happy with all I ordered. I even tried the sour which was good too. I will definitely be back and may even turn into my local hang out with friends.,2022-01-01 20:47:47

jpfgRBZ9yImfgPaU-zRybQ,4r4B36aNolZKmMi8yZzUww,"Patriots stay away. 

Dr. Jermey is a weak man that abuses his power to fire stellar employees that are medically exempt from the forced vaccine for COVID-19. He was so weak that he couldn't outright ask his employees their status- upon basically harassing and finding out he immediately terminated an elderly naturopathic doctor and the massage therapist that had him implement any sort of protocol to the office in the first place as he was never complaint from the beginning. All of the sudden he went full in talked down and degraded these women due to his very one sided stuck thinking. Do your research, sorry but you're wrong...

Stay away from this place. The owner is unsure of himself and doesn't know how to run a business. The employee turnover rate is rapid and they will spam you with poorly created emails and Groupon deals begging for your business. . 

I'll be recommending the DOH and other authorities to check in on these two offices there are some shady practices and they are not accurately following any of the ridiculous and ever changing CDC protocol.",2022-01-08 11:34:25

They left it rocky and never planted grass seed. After several requests they ultimately fixed it. In September my uncle was buried. The grave area is a total mess. Nothing was done to level the dirt. It is obviously never attended to. When arriving to the cemetery the fence is a complete disgrace. I believe the fence needs replacement. It is rusty and in poor condition.

Live music, beignets, wine, what more could you look for?  I was surprised by just how many food options there were--there should be something for all the people in your group! The ticket system makes it really efficient to buy your food/drinks.  You'll buy your food/drink tickets in batches at specific stands which you use for the vendors.   

It is definitely a CROWDED event. Plan on parking a few blocks away. If you go later in the day, all the tables will already be claimed since many people literally will spend the whole day here.  Maybe bring a lawn chair for back-up seating! 

Bonus Tip: While you are in Meridian Kessler, be sure to take a walk around to checkout the unique architecture in the neighborhood. From itty-bitty bungalows, Tudors, Colonial, and more there is so much to take a peak at.

It takes you through the history of NOLA and the surrounding area, with special exhibits to artists in the area.

1I-BRJbGl7cUXQdIhh_LQA,J2yUdxRA0FuQFsky-UF1ug,"I left a complaint on the customer service support line, but it has been almost three months with no response, so I thought I'd share my thoughts here. 

I had an oil change done on my Tacoma. The oil change lasted roughly 32minutes. In addition, the young man who did the oil change seemed to have left the skid plate loose to the point where I heard it rattling while driving on the highway. When I got home, I found the skid plate uneven. It appears that instead of threading on the screws by hand and then tightening them onto the skid plate instead he just jammed the screws in, damaging the thread. This seems like a minor issue, but now I'm thinking about what else could have been done wrong.

I'd rather take 30minutes and have the job done right and at a lower price than 30minutes and have to deal with this inconvenience.

BOTTOM LINE: 
Avoid if you drive a Tacoma. 

 I now see myself doing my oil changes to prevent things like this from happening in the future.",2022-01-16 21:35:05

The person I spoke with (male) during the evening -Took no accountability for the food and refused to take accountability for it. Incredibly rude over the phone and tried to blame door dash for the food the restaurant made. Has no basic understanding of door dash at all. this is very unprofessional and not ok. I do NOT recommend this place. try going to turmeric instead. better customer service and more accountability.  im apalled by the way im being treated as a customer. The guy I spoke with ought to be fired for his unprofessional behavior this is not the way to speak to customers. so rude, no restaurant in the area would talk/treat customers this way. If they call and politely tell you that the food wasn't good ....a  restaurant with accountability can apologize, either refund the money and/or give another menu item. If FAST FOOD places can do this, and other restaurants can do this, they can too. I've never been more aggravated before. I can't believe the sheer rudeness of the person I spoke with.

There were many people milling outside the entrance.  I walked in and gave them my name.  They wished me a happy anniversary (our 50th) which was a nice touch and asked us to wait outside.  Even with all of the people waiting to get in, we were called only seven minutes after our reservation.  Very impressive.  We were seated and Daniela, our server, arrived almost immediately.  She also wished us a happy anniversary and took our drink orders.  The restaurant was so cold they could have hung raw meat in the dining room to have it stay fresh but we each brought a light jacket with us for moments just like this.  So far, so good. Now on to the food.  We hit the salad bar first.  If only it tasted as good as it looked.  Most of the good tasting items were average and some were pretty awful.  My wife said the hearts of palm were inedible and the potatoes au gratin were exceptionally tasteless.  We were not going to let that get us down on our 50th plus we did not go there for salad.  Unfortunately, the meats were not much better.  Some were quite good (the flank steak and the top sirloin) and others were too well done, too salty or just plain tasteless they were inedible.  Had the Gauchos not told us, you couldn't figure out what cut of meat it was.  Being it was our anniversary, we were getting a piece of anniversary cheesecake provide by the restaurant.  My email stated it was their special ""Texas de Brazil Cheesecake"".  It turned out to be a slice of previously frozen plain cheesecake looking nothing like what was pictured on either their website or come join us for dinner emails.  They should be ashamed of that.  All in all, the only reason they get three stars is the excellent service from our server and the great cheese bread.  This was a big letdown.  There are many better Brazilian steakhouse options.  Fortunately, we left and decided to go to the Seminole Hard Rock Casino to continue celebrating and where our luck turned for the better.",2022-01-14 15:48:02

From the pepper crusted filet to the short rib risotto, each entree was a home run. The appetizers were on point. I love the bruschetta trio (one grapes saturated with honey, sounded odd but was one of favorite), I do think they should offer the traditional bruschetta as full appetizer, I think it would benefit them since its really good.

I LOVE MULLED WINE AND couldn't decide between their selection.....Spiced Apple or Holiday Spirit. The host at the wine tasting bar offered samples to assist with my decision.

But I am changing my rating after I took my truck in for it's first oil change and found out I was being charged full price even though I have the GEM membership. (5 free oil changes for first 5 years) To keep this short, it is due to a incorrect date listing on there finance records. With one date saying I bought the truck in November 2020 and another saying the correct date of February 2021. This nullified my entire membership on there books even though I have the appropriate paperwork saying otherwise. The rating at this point is because it has been a month and a half of me reaching out to the dealership and all I receive back is ""ya it should be taken care of in a couple days"". Not once have they reached out to update me about anything. It's more of a major inconvenience and shows there lack of customer service capabilities that I did not expect from a well respected company and brand. I will have a tough time recommending Toyota at any point in the future even though I do truly love my truck. As well, the remote connect with your phone is only a trail to give you a heads up as mine ended after eight months even though I have heard of other people getting the service for 2 years?

impressed with how clean and modern the interior was.
Definitely a bit more upscale than your typical hole in
the wall Chinese restaurant. Altogether, 3 of us ordered
5 dishes (including 2 appetizers) : Dan Dan noodles,
scallion pancakes, fatty beef sour radish soup, salt and
pepper dried squid, and spicy lamb chops.
Squid was an easy favorite, but I'm always a sucker for
that chewy goodness. I have to give a special shout out
to the radish soup. I would order this dish again just for
the noodles. They had this almost firm-Jello-like
consistency that gave the most perfect bite! And the
broth itself was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it.
Wouldn't order the lamb chops again - meat was dry
and it didn't go too well with the cumin marinade.

rGF5GwENwPk-_bFGfb9eVA,LHQCNsF-VEFOV0xRlfLuLQ,"Recommended: Expert staff, and top-quality supplies and feeders.

We have room with large windows facing a small courtyard that seemed perfect for a couple of bird feeders,  and wanted to attract hummingbirds and small birds.  In Tucson, hummingbird supplies are available in most hardware and independent pet supply shops.  So why shop here?  In a word, bird expertise and top-quality bird food and supplies.  I had really mixed results, not attracting the birds we wanted to see, and other small challenges, and the advice was really helpful.  I had challenges such as: I was baffled when my humming bird feeders would empty out in a single night.  ""Nectar bats"" were the culprit, according to store staff.  They knock the hummingbird feeders such that that spill the nectar, and catch the nectar in mid-flight.  ""But they migrate, and they'll be gone in a month.  You can bring the feeder in at night.""  Okay.  That was indeed the culprit.

Then we wanted to attract smaller birds.  ""Try the finch feeder -- only finches can feed on it, and it uses a special seed that only finches eat.""  Okay.  Tried it, and of course, it worked.

The larger birds, especially the white pigeons, were pretty aggressive.  ""Try this feeder -- it's such that the larger birds can't perch and feed.""  Okay.  Tried that, and it worked as advertised (large birds eat the seed that falls to the ground -- win-win for all concerned).  

The bottom line: We follow staff advice, and now, on most days, the courtyard looks like an aviary.",2022-01-10 19:30:11

XW6BU6Y5ULACzf_DU9C2sw,ta0D02-YVpTJ5gzMAUMBTQ,"Uhm not so sure about this place. I've been only one times before. Long before Covid. I know that has changed A LOT of things in the restaurant/business world. Hubby brought me here on a Monday as the sign said open. As noted it's a bit of a strange location, but the interior really is beautiful.  I think we got there about 3:30 and walked in to the place all to ourselves.  Nobody was behind the bar, we kind of saw half of someone lingering in the back. About 6-7 minutes of just sitting there (also got uninterrupted pictures of the place so that was cool) a lady walked out and asked if she could help us.  It was the most unwelcome greeting I've had in a long time. I asked if they had butterscotch schnapps as that is what I was craving, they do not so I just ordered a white Russian as a martini.  My husband ordered a Shirley temple as he is not a big drinker. She like half laughed/scoffed at him in the rudest way when he ordered that. I was pretty angry when she did that and felt like leaving right then and there. Not to mention sounded like she had been coughing in the back room before coming out. 

However she then ended up asking me if I would like vanilla vodka in my drink and I said yes. I thought that was nice she asked.  She made our drinks and we ordered a pepperoni flat bread.  Seems she may have been the only worker as she went in the back and stayed there, all the while coughing more which really stressed me out. Wondering if she was tainting our food honestly, hate to think like that but the vibe we got was not good. 

While drinking my drink it was okay I kind of didn't like it but it was drinkable, I noted to my husband that it tasted a little too much like a coffee espresso drink and that I had never had a White Russian that tasted like that - maybe the vanilla vodka had thrown it off.  Of note, I do not drink coffee I don't like it.  The pizza then came out looking delicious, And it was. It was very very good with lots of pepperoni that had a great kick to it.  Once we finished that we were ready to go. Nobody else had come in yet and it was just very awkward.  She warmed up s bit knowing we were leaving and asked how my drink was, I said it was good - she pulled out a bottle and said ""I used this instead of kahlua"" - it was espresso liquor.  It was strange to me that she asked if vanilla vodka was ok but didn't ask if his espresso liquor was ok. I would have said no to that. Cry face. 

Anyhow I think she was happy to see us go and we were happy to go.  The reason for 3 stars is the flatbread and the atmosphere/decor. Seems like it could be an amazing place, we may try it on a weekend night instead of when nobody else is there but I also was pretty turned off by the whole experience, however again i do know things are weird. I'm not sure if that was the owner we encountered. I came upon a review about a year ago that touched on same thing as me, a very unwelcoming feeling. Very strange as that initial interaction set the tone, would have been nice if she had come out introduced Herself and acted like she cared. :(",2022-01-19 04:29:35

READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS before you consider living in this apartment complex. The staff is condescending, unprofessional, and inexperienced. I've had problems with this complex from the day I moved in, which due to a leasing office mistake I moved in a day later than scheduled.

The first maintenance request my roommate and I reported was about our a/c not working on the hottest days of the year.After 3 days maintenance was sent down, looked at our thermostat and told us nothing was wrong. Our thermostat was set to 75 degrees, but was constantly running for 18 hrs a day and the temperature was staying at 89 degrees all day long.Three days later the A/C was still constantly running and had not been repaired.4 more calls, and around a week later during a call to the front office, I requested to speak to the property manager and maintenance supervisor ASAP, at this point the lady working in the office yells at me!! She said ""Who the hell do you think you are? You can't tell me what to do!""... I hung up and 10 minutes later maintenance was at my door, took an hour to repair my A/C, and again said nothing was wrong. Due to the lack of repairs our electrical bill TRIPLED in price!!

During the summer storms this year my unit received plenty of water damage to the ceiling, and the walls. My roommate and I again, reported it the same day it occurred. A day later maintenance shows up  with buckets to catch the dripping water and cuts the bubbled ceiling off to let the drywall dry. A week goes by with no sign of the maintenance coming back and we notice staining and green/brown/orange/black/grey mildew and mold growing around the cut out area. I am allergic to mold and reported it to the office staff immediately, the answer I got was unacceptable and extremely unprofessional....... I was told that Arizona doesn't have a mold problem and they would paint over it when they got the chance.... Completely disregarding my allergy. TWO MONTHS go by and not a single repair was made for the water damage, I personally went to the office to speak the the property manager and I was told my unit was the worst in the whole complex and they wouldn't work on it because the roof was under warranty and they wont touch it until they get that settled. I gave it another two weeks and not a single email, phone call, nothing. I once again go to the office and they feed me the same line, but this time the property manager offers to move us to a sister complex with higher rent and less amenities. I said no. Then she offered an apartment in this same complex two buildings over that also did not have the same amenities and we would have to wait three months just before we moved in. I said no. We signed a lease for this exact apartment and they are supposed to keep it habitable and make reasonable repairs in a timely manner. Not a single update came back to us. We made a final maintenance request and demanded it be taken care of. The same day the maintenance supervisor came and cut the moldy drywall off the ceiling, exposed the rotting insulation, scraped off the mold and then placed the exact same piece of drywall back onto the roof and covered it up. We immediately told him that was not acceptable and we were not satisfied with the repair made. Another note, the maintenance WILL NOT clean up their mess. They left drywall shaving/paint/scuff marks all over the carpet, ""wood"" floors, and the walls, shown in pictures below. Now they claim to have fixed the issue and have not made anymore repairs. There is still a hole in the master bedroom bathroom that you can see in the pictures below. It has been 6 WHOLE MONTHS since I first reported this problem and I am still living with holes in my walls.

I could type pages explaining all the problems we have encountered at this unprofessional apartment complex but I decided to compact it to the most unsettling events.

If you haven't been to Garwood's or Riva Grill, you definitely need to check out Sparks water bar. They all have beautiful views and similar decor, menu, and great service. The location is what makes this place extra special and worth the higher price tag, it's a beautiful experience to go along with good food and drinks. 

We started out with the classic Woody's, their signature cocktail that is fruity and blended with lots of rum. These go down easy!

We skipped appetizers and went straight to our meal, again, the price tag is a bit hefty so we were being mindful of the overall bill.

See photos for exactly what we ordered, everyone was pleased with their meal. I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and beautifully presented. The risotto was very creamy, almost a bit too much for my taste. I like a good al dente risotto. Hubby said that his prime rib was not as good as he expected. It is a very thick cut and was not very tender, although well seasoned and well sauced. The salmon was cooked medium, which is great for a salmon lover but my sister was thrown off that it wasn't fully cooked, but was also not asked how she'd like it done. She said it was delicious anyway. The pasta dish was a cross between carbonara and mac & cheese - very rich and creamy!

This is a simple dish, but it is full of flavor. The coconut rice is outstanding, but the star of the show was the sauce! It was so good!

Here's a fun fact, even if you have purchased points with Capital Vacations, when you transfer those points to RCI for an exchange, those points get converted to a complimentary weeks exchange (NOT a points exchange).
Because of this fun little nuance, RCI will not allow you to protect your trip with insurance protection (usually costs around $89), in the event something happens prior to your trip (like getting COVID) and thus you can't go on your trip.

If you find yourself in a situation where you can't go on your trip, you will lose that complimentary week at RCI and thus lose your points at Capital Vacations, as the customer service person so eloquently told me, basically, your out of luck.

While we were waiting for our food, the guy working the oyster bar told us the manager decided to stop selling oysters so the employees could get out of there quicker since it's been a long day for them. They were also closing 2 hours earlier than their sign, Google, and their website said.

I called three times and finally the front desk said come down and get some towels, so I did! Then I ordered a wake up call and the cord kept coming out of the back of the phone because it was broken. They sent up maintenance who told me not to move the phone so the wire doesn't fall out, duh! Then the next day I called to ask if there was a breakfast they said yes but they didn't know what they had. Then I was getting breakfast when a man came up to me and gave me the third degree about where's my voucher? What voucher I asked? He said I needed to buy a voucher but he never said where, for breakfast which was never communicated by anyone until I was getting breakfast and he had to make a scene in public and I left the food.

the flavoring in the nigiri always seems really thoughtful and the rice is superb, but the rolled sushi doesn't always match that. I'd go for simpler rolls here or skip them entirely and focus on the parts of their menu that really shine.

They do require proof of vaccination to dine in. They're very, VERY public about it, so there's really no need to angrily flounce out of the restaurant like the dude that was in front of me the last time we dined in...and yet.

I loved taking pictures and we were mesmerized by all of the cool animals! We even got to meet/touch Patrick Star!!!
The only downfall is the price. Unless you are getting the year membership and are going to go several times throughout the year, it's expensive.

My wife loved the sausage sandwich. They slice the sausage down with the peppers and onions. It makes the sandwich look a little slender as opposed to serving it intact, but I assure you it had enough. She needed a fork to finish the insides. I tasted and I concur. That's a worthy sandwich. 

I tried the cheeseburger. Just went for a basic single with cheese to see how they did it. It had a decent enough amount of beef. I didn't feel like it skimped. It's on par with the Zac's and Nifty Fifty's level, smash style. I'd keep it in my burger rotation. 

I also tried a Texas Tommy. Great flavor. The bacon crisped nice around the dog. Just the way I like it. 

We all loved the fries. Excellent shoestring style. Dare I say on par with McDonalds. 

Now my son... he's a little picky. And he's recently learned about the Portnoy pizza scale. So he scores everything now. He gave the cheeseburger a 6.6. Said it was good but not the best he's had. But the hot dog was an 8.9 which was excellent. And a 10 on the fries (rookie score). 

He's tough. He's a picky 8 year old. Get on his case not mine.

The broccolini I had was awful, like trying to cut through and chew bamboo. And the meal did not have a starch component?  Why?  Just salty chicken and bamboo-like broccolini.

Our table had tacos, enchiladas, massive steak burrito which was amazing. Our server was attentive.  All in all Pretty great.  And we made the theater with 10 min to spare!  Thank you Hidalgo's we will see you again soon!",2022-01-16 03:27:30

The prices are really reasonable here too. It's a great place to go with people or alone to get some work done in a great environment.",2022-01-09 02:07:36

Always start off with a dozen charbroiled oysters...garlicky deliciousness. The sauté shrimp  is amazing and very filling. Always get so full that I have yet to be able to try dessert. Well maybe next time!!",2022-01-14 19:48:34

The morning breakfast had all the essentially for a great hotel breakfast before work with an attentive and hard working attendant. Thanks for providing a warm and safe place to sleep during the recent snow storm. Recommend this property.",2022-01-08 23:00:58
xobou_oRxLc48aCPQ8uy_w,GuzbBFraIq-fbkjfvaTRvg,"Pretty disappointing. I've been wanting to eat here for several years based on what I thought was a great reputation in town.  I don't get over to the Mesa much but when I saw a coupon in a mailed flyer a couple months ago, I clipped it.  It offered a free entree with purchase of one entree and two drinks. Even with a discount of $12, the bill was $53 for lunch (before tip) -- I can eat a great dinner out for less than this -- so I was expecting a very delicious meal.  Both my companion and I felt the food was vastly overpriced for the quality, flavor and even presentation. The quantity was generous enough but the items we ordered (empanadas and the mushroom burger) were both rather bland.  The ""burger"" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren't thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not a 'wow' and not even a 'hey, really tasty.' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn't even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.  We took the food to go so I cannot really comment on the service. When I read another lengthy review (12/5/21), I now see that the prices have been jacked and the quality has been wavering. I totally understand the precarious state of the restaurant business right now during covid but I cannot recommend this restaurant at this time.",2022-01-15 20:41:34
cyMEce28nEOVxoPs3jO5cA,9pwzHmhCpgJwfaIP9jWoCg,"Oh my goodness, I don't know that I have any other words for TeeJay's. I was SO excited to have an excuse to go up to TeeJay's even in the middle of December.

Though TeeJay's is only open via drive through, they really have it down to a science. I knew choosing between the donut sandwich or shake would be a hard choice to begin with, but that soon became the easy part when they informed me they were out of both the gingerbread and eggnog ice creams and that I could choose ANY of their other flavors as a shake. I went on the last day of the Elite Event, so I thought it was really nice of them to still allow me to participate and they did as much as they could to give me the same experience.

I ended up going with the graham cracker ice cream and holy cow was it AMAZING! Not only was the ice cream itself delicious, but there were some kind of chocolatey candies in the bottom that were a welcomed surprise when you got to the bottom of the shake. You definitely get your money's worth at TeeJay's, too. I was planning on making dinner after I got back home from picking up my shake and ended up being so full that I didn't cook. Who's really sad about having ice cream for dinner, though?

Bottom line, if you go to TeeJay's, you won't be disappointed. Not only is their ice cream delicious, their staff is very friendly, and they offer some of the most unique shakes and sweet treats I've had the pleasure of trying. I'll definitely be back to try that donut ice cream sandwich.",2022-01-04 02:04:48

Ordering tickets online were simple and easy through their ticket system for a time and date that works best for our group. Tickets go quickly and when we arrived there, I can understand. With Longwood Gardens part of the Museum for All program so the tickets were cheaper but the price of the ticket is worth it to see all the different light displays around the Garden at night.

You'll be trekking through the Gardens majority outdoors but there are some indoor spots, but bundle up tight and grab some spiced hot chocolate for the walk. You could also drop by the Beer Garden to grab a drink and warm up in the indoor spaces.

Weather is the trickiest part to plan, the weather the day that we went drizzled a little but the Gardens continue to open rain or shine.

There are portions that you would yearn for more lights but the biggest attraction that we enjoyed were the dancing light displays that play holiday music with lights moving about.

They do have seasonal times with lights and displays, we will come back to visit during other times of the year and see what the Gardens have to offer.",2022-01-06 01:06:29
