My wife said the hearts of palm were inedible and the potatoes au gratin were exceptionally tasteless.  We were not going to let that get us down on our 50th plus we did not go there for salad.  Unfortunately, the meats were not much better.  Some were quite good (the flank steak and the top sirloin) and others were too well done, too salty or just plain tasteless they were inedible.  Had the Gauchos not told us, you couldn\\'t figure out what cut of meat it was.  Being it was our anniversary, we were getting a piece of anniversary cheesecake provide by the restaurant.

Hubby brought me here on a Monday as the sign said open. As noted it\\'s a bit of a strange location, but the interior really is beautiful.  I think we got there about 3:30 and walked in to the place all to ourselves.  Nobody was behind the bar, we kind of saw half of someone lingering in the back. About 6-7 minutes of just sitting there (also got uninterrupted pictures of the place so that was cool) a lady walked out and asked if she could help us.  It was the most unwelcome greeting I\\'ve had in a long time. I asked if they had butterscotch schnapps as that is what I was craving, they do not so I just ordered a white Russian as a martini.  My husband ordered a Shirley temple as he is not a big drinker. She like half laughed/scoffed at him in the rudest way when he ordered that. I was pretty angry when she did that and felt like leaving right then and there. Not to mention sounded like she had been coughing in the back room before coming out. \\n\\nHowever she then ended up asking me if I would like vanilla vodka in my drink and I said yes. I thought that was nice she asked.  She made our drinks and we ordered a pepperoni flat bread.  Seems she may have been the only worker as she went in the back and stayed there, all the while coughing more which really stressed me out. Wondering if she was tainting our food honestly, hate to think like that but the vibe we got was not good. \\n\\nWhile drinking my drink it was okay I kind of didn\\'t like it but it was drinkable, I noted to my husband that it tasted a little too much like a coffee espresso drink and that I had never had a White Russian that tasted like that - maybe the vanilla vodka had thrown it off.  Of note, I do not drink coffee I don\\'t like it.  The pizza then came out looking delicious, And it was. It was very very good with lots of pepperoni that had a great kick to it.  Once we finished that we were ready to go. Nobody else had come in yet and it was just very awkward.  She warmed up s bit knowing we were leaving and asked how my drink was, I said it was good - she pulled out a bottle and said \"I used this instead of kahlua\" - it was espresso liquor.  It was strange to me that she asked if vanilla vodka was ok but didn\\'t ask if his espresso liquor was ok. I would have said no to that. Cry face. \\n\\nAnyhow I think she was happy to see us go and we were happy to go.  The reason for 3 stars is the flatbread and the atmosphere/decor. Seems like it could be an amazing place, we may try it on a weekend night instead of when nobody else is there but I also was pretty turned off by the whole experience, however again i do know things are weird. I\\'m not sure if that was the owner we encountered. I came upon a review about a year ago that touched on same thing as me, a very unwelcoming feeling. Very strange as that initial interaction set the tone, would have been nice if she had come out introduced Herself and acted like she cared. :(',\n",

There was one bartender and I couldn't tell if she was in a bad mood, acted normally like that, or would just rather spend her shift talking to her friends on the other side of the bar. We got our food after a bit and had to ask for new avocado since the ones in our plate were literally black. Food was ok the first trip. \\nTried it again this week and wanted to give it another shot since they have a wide beer selection. Sat at the bar with my buddy and the bartender was nicer, but same wait time...not many people at the bar and takes a while to get service or your check, even after making eye contact. Food was worse this time and my buddy said his Alfredo looked like a 4th grader made it from a box. I wanted to like it, but there are better places to go for sports and beer without having to feel like an inconvenience or get iffy food. \\nWater and silverware don't come standard apparently, at least at the bar.\",\n",

The staff is condescending, unprofessional, and inexperienced. I\\'ve had problems with this complex from the day I moved in, which due to a leasing office mistake I moved in a day later than scheduled.\\n\\nThe first maintenance request my roommate and I reported was about our a/c not working on the hottest days of the year.After 3 days maintenance was sent down, looked at our thermostat and told us nothing was wrong. Our thermostat was set to 75 degrees, but was constantly running for 18 hrs a day and the temperature was staying at 89 degrees all day long.Three days later the A/C was still constantly running and had not been repaired.4 more calls, and around a week later during a call to the front office, I requested to speak to the property manager and maintenance supervisor ASAP, at this point the lady working in the office yells at me!! She said \"Who the hell do you think you are? You can\\'t tell me what to do!\"... I hung up and 10 minutes later maintenance was at my door, took an hour to repair my A/C, and again said nothing was wrong. Due to the lack of repairs our electrical bill TRIPLED in price!!\\n\\nDuring the summer storms this year my unit received plenty of water damage to the ceiling, and the walls. My roommate and I again, reported it the same day it occurred. A day later maintenance shows up  with buckets to catch the dripping water and cuts the bubbled ceiling off to let the drywall dry. A week goes by with no sign of the maintenance coming back and we notice staining and green/brown/orange/black/grey mildew and mold growing around the cut out area. I am allergic to mold and reported it to the office staff immediately, the answer I got was unacceptable and extremely unprofessional....... I was told that Arizona doesn\\'t have a mold problem and they would paint over it when they got the chance.... Completely disregarding my allergy. TWO MONTHS go by and not a single repair was made for the water damage, I personally went to the office to speak the the property manager and I was told my unit was the worst in the whole complex and they wouldn\\'t work on it because the roof was under warranty and they wont touch it until they get that settled. I gave it another two weeks and not a single email, phone call, nothing. I once again go to the office and they feed me the same line, but this time the property manager offers to move us to a sister complex with higher rent and less amenities. I said no. Then she offered an apartment in this same complex two buildings over that also did not have the same amenities and we would have to wait three months just before we moved in. I said no. We signed a lease for this exact apartment and they are supposed to keep it habitable and make reasonable repairs in a timely manner. Not a single update came back to us. We made a final maintenance request and demanded it be taken care of. The same day the maintenance supervisor came and cut the moldy drywall off the ceiling, exposed the rotting insulation, scraped off the mold and then placed the exact same piece of drywall back onto the roof and covered it up. We immediately told him that was not acceptable and we were not satisfied with the repair made. Another note, the maintenance WILL NOT clean up their mess. They left drywall shaving/paint/scuff marks all over the carpet, \"wood\" floors, and the walls, shown in pictures below. Now they claim to have fixed the issue and have not made anymore repairs.

I asked about rescheduling him for this Friday (7th), she told me she could not do that because she wasn\\'t in grooming and she did not know if they had availability. I asked her several questions - even asked if they could fit Willy into the schedule with Isabelle. She kept arguing with me. I asked to speak to the grooming manager - she wasn\\'t there.
